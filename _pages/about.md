I am a Research Fellow, at the School of Computing (SoC)<!--and Institute for Functional Intelligent Materials (IFIM)-->, National University of Singapore (NUS). <!--, where I work on <b>Graph Neural Networks</b> and their applications in molecular representation learning.-->

My general research interest lies in <b>Machine Learning</b> and its appliations, with specific focus on <b>Representation learning, Probabilistic modeling and Generative modeling</b>. Over the last few years, I have worked on representation learning on the graph structured data with applications in vision, language and Science. Currently working on <b>Discrete generative modeling</b> at the intersection of Graph and Language domains.

Previously, I graduated with a <b>PhD in Computer Science</b> from SoC, NUS where I was advised by [Prof. Lee Wee Sun](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leews/). My PhD thesis work was focussed on improving the expressive power of Graph Neural Networks.
